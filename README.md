# BeachyWorlds
This is the **backup** files of the once-active Classicube server **BeachyWorlds**.
_MCGalaxy is made by UnknownShadow200 and Classicube is made by AndrewPH, with no affilation to Mojang or Microsoft._

# Set up Instructions:
First, download the files; then extract the tar.zip and open MCGalaxy.exe. 
Optionally afterwards, you will need to port foward to make it appear on ClassiCube's server list, however: before you do this, be sure to change the owner in properties/server.properties to your username instead of Desaxu (so that way people don't think i'm (Desaxu) the owner of the server.

After all that, you are done!

# things to remember:
- **the blockdb, logs, levels, and extra folder have a placeholder empty.txt file due to it being past GitHub's 100 file upload limit**
- ranks are unchanged, so I (Desaxu) will be the owner rank, unless you unrank me to member with /rank (user) (rank)
