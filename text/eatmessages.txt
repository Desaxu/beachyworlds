ate an avacado
drank some milk
consumed an orange
nibbled on a banana
drank a smoothie
drank some mountain dew
drank some pepsi
drank coca cola
ate air
drank from a bottle of water
figured eating lemons was the best choice (it was not.)
consumed grapes
consumed a strawberry
suddenly nibbled on a lamp
got a fork comically stuck in their neck
suddenly was glowing blue from mushrooms
