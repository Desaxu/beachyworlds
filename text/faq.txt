%yQ: Is this server new?%f
%bA: Not really. BeachyWorlds was made back in 2021 as a general freebuild server, albeit now it keeps that style with parkour and the such. This server was called Ravenshade back in early 2022 as a "rebrand" and it was generally different in terms of style, but kept that "hangout" theme. %f

%yQ: Does this server copy other popular servers like New Blood or Not Awesome 2?%f
%bA: Nope. With New Blood having 2 servers (Zombie Survival and Map Building) and Not Awesome 2's style is mostly on an "adventure hangout" server, this server is an inspiration.%f

%yQ: Can i get staff?%f
%bA: This server's staff process is just like NA2's staff system; Invite-only. Just like in NA2, asking for it will only result in you very likely getting no staff rank.%f

%yQ: Who made this server?%f
%bA: Desaxu (otherwise known as Nitro or _uwt outside the classicube community.) He is responsible for the existance of this server, and it was created on eddynetweb, a server hosting site by eddynet.%f
